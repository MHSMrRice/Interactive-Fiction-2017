<h1>The teens search for the way out of the woods...
</h1>

<img src="page6picture.jpg" alt="page6picture">

<p>Since the ghost was weak, the woods started to change. The teens found the way they came in and ran
    towards it. They got out of the woods and there was a road. A car is driving by and they wave it 
    down and get in. The guy is like, "What happened?" The teens say, "We just got out of the woods. We're
    the only people ever to survive the woods!" The guy recognizes the teens and says, "You guys are
    the mission teens that have been gone for weeks!" He notifies the police and they come to 
    bring each teen home to their families. Each teen never even came close to those woods again.

<p>The teens wake up the next day with the biggest headache of their lives. They're still in the
    abandoned house, wondering how they got there. Then, they remembered that a ghost was chasing 
    them. All the sudden this creepy man walks into the house, and the teens ask, "Who are you, can
    you help us?" The man says no, "I'm the famous ghost everybody talks about." The teens say, 
    "But you are a human not a ghost!" The man explains how people think he is a ghost. He has these
    drugs that mess with your mind and he and puts them into a misty form, and when people come into
    the wood he sprays them. After it is in your blood stream, the effects happen fast. The man can 
    control what he wants them to see so he always picks the ghost. After he tells the story the

<h1>The teens run the other way...
</h1>

<img src="page3picture.jpg" alt="page3picture">

<p>All the teens ran the other way to avoid the ghost and scattered across the forest. The ghost trap, set by
    the ghost to catch the teens, didn't work. The trap was faulty because the ghost is very weak. It hasn't eaten for 
    awhile. It's hard for the ghost to catch its food and set certain spells that hold the teens in the woods. The ghost
    can do certain spells to keep people or things in the woods so they can't get out. So, the ghost has to go with a 
    different option, which is kill another animal to survive for a few hours until it tries to get a human, because humans
    taste better and give a longer lifespan to the ghost.

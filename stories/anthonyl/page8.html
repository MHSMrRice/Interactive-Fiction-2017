<h1>The teens decided to try to make peace with the ghost...
</h1>

<p>So all of the teens stop running away from the ghost, and one of the teens says, "Let's go back and
    see if we can make peace with the ghost." So all of the teens agree and start walking back where 
    the ghost popped out of, and they see it. So they say, "Hey ghost, stop! We want to talk to you." 
    The ghost stops quickly and turns around, hovering, and speeds towards them, stopping right in front of
    their faces. The teens ask, "Why are you doing this? Can we make peace?" The ghost says, "I need to
    eat to survive, and the animals in these woods are not doing the job that humans do." The teens ask,
    "Please can we just leave and we will never come back again!" The ghost says, "oh hell naw, I need to eat," 
    so the ghost uses every last strength of its powers and starts to squeeze all the teens, killing them
    one by one, and then eats them.

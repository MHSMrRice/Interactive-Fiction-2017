<h1>All the teens get away, except for one of the boys...
</h1>

<p>Every teen ran and split up, but one of the boys didn't make it because he fell. The ghost got to the
    boy and ate him. Now all the teens have about 24 hours to try to escape the woods. They all meet up
    with each other and every teen starts freaking out. One of them said, "Hey let's try to find a way
    out of these woods."So they retraced their steps, back from the way they came in. But the ghost is 
    still messing with their minds so they can't get out.

<h1>The teens keep running until they find a way out of the woods...
</h1>

<p>After seeing the ghost the teens start running away, trying to find a way out. But they can't, they are
    just running around in different directions getting more lost every step. After running around
    in the woods for a while, the teens get super exhausted and fall asleep. And the teens never wake up again.
    The ghost caught them in their sleep and had a filling late night snack.

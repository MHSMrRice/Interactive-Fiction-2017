<p>After all the teens got home, they were still scared that the ghost would come for them. It had been 
    a few weeks, and the teens think they are okay, believing the ghost won't coming for them. Then, one gloomy 
    night, when all the teens had a sleep over, the ghost came when they were sleeping and killed them
    all except for one. The ghost went into the teen's body and took over it, so that the ghost could live in 
    humanity again.

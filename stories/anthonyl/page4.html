<P>Every teens stays together and tries to fight the ghost. The ghost traps them in an invisible circle 
    which comes from its mind. Then, it throws an invisible rope that comes from its fingers on all of 
    them and squeezes them to death. Their eyeballs pop out of their heads, their brains get
    squeezed so hard it comes out of their ears. Every teen dies.

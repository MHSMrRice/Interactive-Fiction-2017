<h1> The teens go towards the voice...
</h1>

<img src="page2picture.jpg" alt="page2picture">

<p> The teens are in the middle of the woods, and the ghost pops out from the ground and starts chasing them. 
     If the ghost catches them, it kills them. The way it kills you is it sucks itself into your body
     and rips you up from the inside out. Then it eats your soul. That single soul will last the ghost for a day
     before it gets hungry again.

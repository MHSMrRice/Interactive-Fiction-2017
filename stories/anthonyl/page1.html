<h1>Introduction

<p>It was a dark, gloomy, night when five teens went into the woods. There were three guys and two girls. 
People told them these woods were haunted, but they didn't believe it. So, the teens went into the woods 
to prove it was not haunted. They heard that in the woods there was a ghost that feasted on humans. When
they stepped into the woods, the ghost sensed them and the teens heard a voice-like whisper.

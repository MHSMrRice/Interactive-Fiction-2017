<h1>The teens cannot find a way out of the woods...
</h1>

<img src="page7picture.jpg" alt="page7picture">

<p>The teens still can't find a way out, so they start just wandering the woods. They see something
    in the distance. It is a house. It looks super scary and abandoned. It is starting to get dark 
    outside, so they go into the house while it is still light outside, so they can check it out.
    One of the teens says, "It's better than staying outside for the night." Everyone else agrees. 
    So the teens gather some wood and start a fire with some old matches they found.

Cody reached out and gave the shark head a double purple nurple,although the shark head didn't have nipples so it really hurt the shark head when he got purple nurpled 
As Cody was fighting through the sea monsters Kito picked up the Keys Cody dropped and used them to unlock his cage and all the others "revolution!!!" Shouted Kito as he and the merpeople and sea creatures charged towards the sea monsters,and with all that out of the way
The Merfolk were back on track with their battle against the sea monsters "Kito do you know how to treat wounds asked Cody not really said kito but I have some healing potion that I keep with me in case of such occasion why do you ask" because Alesha is in the castle and she is badly wounded can you go heal her up while I give my dad an elementary style butt whipping
Don't worry Cody I'll take care of Alesha you take care of your dad said Kito thank s Kito said Cody I think you make a better King than my old man right back at ay as aid Kito but I'm not sure if I'm fit  to be king

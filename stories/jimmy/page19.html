        "FATHER!?!?!" said a shocked alesha, Alesha couldn't believe her OWN father was leading their enemies. 
                                                                                                 
But cody was even MORE shocked, he just learned that he is really a mermaid and he is alesha's half brother AND his real father is a mermaid king who's been  living a double life,
cody's face was red, he was filled with confusion and sorrow,what was happening to him 
"Why " cody said to the merking it was weird for our hero to call someone  he barley meet dad                                            " why would would you lay seige on your own kingdom?" "because ever since the merfolk won the war long ago against the sea monsters,they grew up fearing the sea monsters,and the sea monsters grew up hating   them,and it is my duty as king to do something about this genocide"said zale  "Now that I know my son I thought have lost has been found,I ask you to join me,you and your sister,reunite with your old man and we will end this genocide once and for all" "No"said Cody I want to end this genocide but not the way you doing it,and I refuse to join forces with a man who solves problems thru violence"







"Very well" said King Zale "then you will suffer like all these Merfolk before"Cody watched as the Merfolk were losing the battle and the monsters were harassing them and chaining them up
"Father"shouted Alesha "how can you let this happen"Alesha charged at her father to attack but 
The king HIT his own daughter, "Alesha"shouted Cody,cody rushed to help his half sisster but the mermaid was badly wounded "I'm gonna kill you"Cody shouted as he approached his so-called "father" ready to attack but then two sea monsters came from behind and they held down Cody
"Your a fool for not doing the right thing"said zale "i wanted us to be together but now you are going to have to suffer for your betrayal "

"Funny i was just about to say the same thing"said cody "take him away"said zaleand as the merfolk were being taken by the monsters,cody and injured alesha were being taken away to a
Room in a castle "you're the worst dad ever you know that"said Cody to King  Zale "oh get used to it"said the king "I hate you"          said Cody

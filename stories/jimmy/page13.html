    When our heroes approached the castle they were greeted by a mermaid in a suit of armour
"Your majesty" said a mermaid  to princess alesha "hello lorelai do you know  where dad is " asked alesha,lorelei is the captain of the merdorian  guard,she is also alesha's nursemaid,ever since alesha's mom passed away,lorelai was like a second mother to our heroine

        "We should make peace" said Cody "what was that again?"asked Lorelai "I think we should go with Kitos idea and bring back balance between Merfolk and sea monsters"Cody told the Merfolk "you are all going to be in for a big surprise but
I am the lost prince" everyone gasp they all knew that their King had a son long ago but they though he died "I know, I was shocked too when I found out but that's another story  right now we have this story to worry about,As the prince of this kingdom I believe it is my duty to bring order to my ocean,and right nowhere is a genocide going on between Merfolk and sea monsters and we need to put an end to it without the act of violence who's with me" the crowd cheered as our hero speech got them motivated to do the right thing "well said cody" said Alesha "now where do we start?"

Meanwhile outside the city gates the sea monsters were preparing for attack 
"Ready to strike at your command sir" said a electric eel general to the monster leader
"Were ready" said the commander "the time has come today we do to the merpeople what they did to us sea monsters years ago" "wait" shouted Cody "a merman" said a crab monster "shall 
We strike em down cap'n" "no let us hear what they have  to say"

                                                                                                         
"We know why you're attacking us,but can't we Merfolk and sea monsters put the past Behind us""The past will be  forgotten once we sea monsters have settled the long genocide with the merpeople" "but why should you  we settle the score with violence what choice do we have" said the commander
  
Cody brought some of the sea monster leaders into the castle war room for a peace meeting
Cody told the sea monsters that he was the lost prince of this kingdom he also mentioned that he forgave them for attacking his home and separating him from his family,he also told them that the war between their ancestors a long time ago was history and that they should put it behind them "also" said cody "i have just put together a peace treaty,stating that if you guys promise to put the past behind you just as we merfolk are about to do,then the kingdom of 
  Will be home to both sea monsters and merfolk and we can all live in harmony just like we did before our ancestors went to war" the sea monsters agreed to this treaty and so to make along story short the sea monsters signed it and the genocide between merfolk and sea monsters ended (or did it)

        Back at home,cody tries to get to the bottom of what happened to him at the meet,one thing he notices is that when he comes in contact with water he grows gills "what is happening to me?"
Thought cody

    </p>
<p>
    "Hey cody i heard about  what happened at your surf meet" said cody's uncle jesse
Well he wasn't really his uncle,he was actually his legal guardian,cody just called him "uncle for the pleasure of it

</p>
<p>
   "it was a miracle that"uncle jesse stopped to see a worried look on his "nephew's" face
"Oh cody i know how badly you wanted to win this year but it's not the last meet of your life there's always next year" "It's not the meet uncle j"said cody "it's that"

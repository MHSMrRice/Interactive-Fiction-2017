Zale fell to his knees(metaphorically) he was foolish to think that persecuting his own people would solve the year long genocide,he wept over what a fool he was
"There there"said cody hugging his father"your son is here for you wow i never thought a child would comfort a parent"

        </p>


    <p>
To make along story short zale repented for his crime,the merfolk and sea monsters stopped fighting and became friends and kito's healing potion was able to heal up alesha and she was back in ship shape

"My people" said zale to his kingdom later that day "first of all i would like to apologize for what i have done  it was foolish to think making you all suffer would end the long war between merfolk and sea monsters. And for you sea monsters the time has come to forget about the past and move on in life,I know that back then we didn't get along,but now we have a chance to make things right our home is now your home. The time has come to put the past behind you,it's time to move on in life you are all welcome in this land, but most of all i would like to thank my son who i thought i lost but have found,prince cody, The man who ended this genocide between merfolks and sea monsters and helped me become whole again " the crowd cheered as cody came up to the balcony,"Now that you know where you belong"said king zale "will you stay with us and live amongst us?"

        As the sea monsters started moving into the city they started to destroy the land making room for them "stop said cody what are you guys doing" "we're moving in duh" said the sea monsters general "but this wasn't part of the treaty you promised to put the past behind you" said cody "oh i'm sorry your highness said the general he held out his hand with his fingers crossed
 "But crosses doesn't count" "You sick.."said cody "ah ah ah" said the general "trash talk,us sea monsters will never forgive you merpeople for kicking us out of the kingdom" said the sea monster captain "i wanted the merfolk and sea monsters to live in peace now i realize that taking you guys down is the only way to end this war"said cody "so be it"said the captain "attack" the captain said to his troops "counterattack"cody said to the merpeople and so to make a long story short,the merfolk and sea monsters got into a roughhousing battle,it ended when the king of merdor returned to his kingdom and he blasted the monsters out of the kingdom with his trident after that situation Cody told hai father that he was his lost son the king was overjoyed over his son's return he threw a party to celebrate our heroes homecoming,but one thing on cody's mind was if he should stay with the merpeople of should he go back to the surface ,well that's another story.


Man,it seems like the merfolk and sea monsters will never get along,but will the war ever end? well if you go back to page 11 and go down a different path there might be a way for the war to end permanently,but until then i have to say

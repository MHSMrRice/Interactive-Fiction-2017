        Cody though for a moment,he looked at his uncle,then at the locket "mom" cody said
"I have created a whole life here" said cody i'm even in an organized sport,so with all due respect I wish to stay here on the surface"
    
        </p>

<p>
    Cody's mom smiled "cody you are a grown man so you are free to make your own choices but please take this gift from me" cody's mom handed her a ring "when you look into the gem of this ring you will be brought back to my home just in case you change your mind"
And so after cody's mom got out of the hospital she went back to the ocean leaving her son with the man who raised him.

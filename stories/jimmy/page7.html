Cody is picking a fight with two stingray headed monsters,one of them stings cody,but then cody 
Throws garavel in their eyes,which thankfully there was some next to him, then with the stingray dudes rubbing their eyes Cody punched both of them in the faces really hard the stingrays could not take it so they retreated

    "Wew thanks for rescue"said the mermaid "i couldn't just stand there while you were being chased by weird looking monsters"said cody "why were those stingray dudes chasing you" 
"Well i was just going to see a relative when I heard conversation coming from a sea trench
Said the mermaid "i know it’s wrong to eavesdrop but i thought i heard someone say something about killing my father the sea king, and stealing his throne although i think i might have got their attention because the next thing you know i'm being chase by …. Well you saw the whole thing so you know what happens

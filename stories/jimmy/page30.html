           And so to make a long story short ,cody realized his place was with the merpeople,with

everyone on the surface looking for him after his disappearance Cody went to the surface and

told them everything about how he's a merman and that he has a new life to live,everyone was

bummed over hardly being able to see their friend again but Cody promised them he would

come to visit.

visit his friends on the surface but he was happy we're he was living under the sea,eventually he

took his father's place as king of merdor,but what about our hero meeting a beautiful mermaid

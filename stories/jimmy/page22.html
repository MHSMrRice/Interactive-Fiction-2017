"Hey pops" said Cody as he barged into the castle "Cody" shouted King Zale "how did you escape "that's not important" said Cody right now we have some important 
"You wish to fight me?" said Zale preparing his weapon "There has been enough violence for one day" said Cody "not to me there isn't" said Zale about to draw his sword "wait! "shouted Cody "if there is a part of you that loves me enough to understand me
then you will hear me out" the king put his weapon back "i'm listening" "i know how you feel about your people fearing the sea monsters, and I understand how the sea monsters hate the merpeople because of what happened between these two a long time ago "said Cody "but that was like what how many years ago, but that doesn't matter what matters is that at was in the past, it's history, can't the merpeople and sea monsters forgive and forget" "all will be forgiven once I have taught my  lesson said the merpeople,can see the sea monsters pain" the king "oh that's a laugh said Cody  "So teaming up with the enemies, wreaking havoc on your own kingdom and abusing your own people, that's your idea of showing another's pain, that doesn't solve any problems, that  just makes your merpeople fear them even more"

what is wrong with you "said Cody "and your people, King Zale was "I'm ashamed, your own daughter looked up to you and this is what you give her...why.." Asked Cody "after that day when the sea monsters invaded,and I told your mother to flee with you and she never returned"said zale "my life was empty,I mean sure I was given a new wife and child but I still missed my old one and every day I wanted to make the sea monsters pay for their sin,so I tried to take them down ,but when i confronted them they told me that they use to live as one with the merpeople but as war broke between them the sea monsters were sent into the undersea,after hearing their story  i felt like it was my OWN kinds fault that my family was taken from me so i teamed up with the sea monsters hoping that we could end the genocide once and for all,but now i see i was wrong...wherever you were the past 16 years you were taught  well, I don't deserve to be king" "but you do deserve the opportunity to change" Said Cody "you have a chance to make things right,put down your weapon, give up your evil desires,end this genocide without having to go into violence you may have lost  your wives but your children are still here"
